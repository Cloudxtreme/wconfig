First you need to have Unix like operating system, i think you have one installed already.

wconfig is a client to wicd daemon, so to use wconfig you need to use wicd :-)

If you meet all requirements you can now install wconfig:
wget https://github.com/webnull/wconfig/raw/master/wconfig.py -O ~/wconfig
su root # or sudo su
chmod +x wconfig
mv wconfig /usr/bin/wconfig

Its installed and its working...
